# Computer Science

Computer science is an academic discipline that involves the study of computers, computational systems, and the design, analysis, and development of algorithms and software programs to solve complex problems and automate tasks. It spans both theoretical and practical aspects of computing, including information theory, automation, and the design and implementation of hardware and software. Although related to computer programming, computer science is a distinct field that focuses on the academic study of computing and the development of novel solutions to challenges in fields such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data science.


Computer scientists use their knowledge and skills to develop new technologies and improve existing ones, making computers and software more efficient, effective, and accessible to users.


> Computer science is primarily about problem solving rather than programming.
